Who wants to live forever~
There's no time for {Gus{x,
There's no place for {Gus{x,
What is this thing that builds our dreams, yet slips away from us.

Who wants to live forever,
Who wants to live forever.....?
There's no chance for us,
It's all decidede for us,
This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us.

Who wants to live forever.
Who dares to live forever,
When love must {Rdie{x.

But touch my tears with your lips,
Touch my world with your fingertips,
And we can have forever,
And we can love forever,
Forever is our today,
Who wants to live forever,
Who wants to live forever,
Forever is our today,
Who waits forever anyway?

A Kind Of Magic~
It's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
A kind of magic,
One dream, one soul, one prize,
One goal, one golden glance of what should be,
It's a kind of magic,
One shaft of light that shows the way,
No mortal man can win this day,
It's a kind of magic,
The bell that rings inside your mind,
Is challenging the doors of time,
It's a kind of magic,
The waiting seems eternity,
The day will down of sanity,
Is this the kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
There can be only one,
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done,
This flame that burns inside of me,
I'm here in secret harmonies
It's a kind of magic,
The bell that rings inside your mind,
Is challenging the doors of time,
It's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
The rage that lasts a thousand years,
Will soon be, will soon be,
Will soon be done,
This is a kind of magic,
There can be only one,
The rage that lasts a thousand years,
Will soon be done,
Magic - it's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
Magic, magic, magic, magic,
It's magic,
It's a kind of magic.

Show.~
Empty spaces - what are we living for
Abandoned places - I guess we know the score
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for...
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore
The show must go on,
The show must go on
Inside me heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on.
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on, does anybody know we are living for?
I guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly - my friends
The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On - with the show -
I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the -
On with the show -
The show must go on...

Yesterday~
     Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away,
     Now it looks as though they're here to stay,
     Oh, I believe in yesterday.

     Suddenly I'm not half a man I used to be,
     There's a shadow hanging over me,
     Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

         Why she has to go? I don't know, she wouldn't say.
         I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

     Yesterday love was such an easy game to play,
     Now I need a place to hide away,
     Oh, I believe in yesterday.

         Why she has to go? I don't know, she wouldn't say.
         I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

     Yesterday love was such an easy game to play,
     Now I need a place to hide away,
     Oh, I believe in yesterday,
     M-m, m-m, m-m, m-m...

I want to break free~
I want to break free
I want to break free
I want to break free from your lies
You're so self satisfied I don't need you
I've got to break free
God knows, God knows I want to break free.

I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love for the first time

And this time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love, yeah
God knows, God knows I've fallen in love.

It's strange but it's true
I can't get over the way you love me like you do
But I have to be sure
When I walk out that door
Oh how I want to be free, baby
Oh how I want to be free,
Oh how I want to break free.

But life still goes on
I can't get used to, living without, living without,
Living without you by my side
I don't want to live alone, hey
God knows, got to make it on my own
So baby can't you see
I've got to break free.

I've got to break free.
I want to break free, yeah
I want, I want, I want, I want to break free.

Bohemian Rhapsody~
Is this the real life -
Is this just fantasy -
Caught in a landslide -
No escape from reality -
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see -
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy -
Because I'm easy come, easy go,
A little high, little low,
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, - to me -,

Mama, just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head,
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead,
Mama, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away -
Mama, ooo,
Didn't mean to make you cry -
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow -
Carry on, carry on, as it nothing really matters -

Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine -
Body's aching all the time,
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go -
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth -
Mama, ooo -
I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all -

I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the Fandango -
Thunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me -
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo
Gallileo figaro - Magnifico -
But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me -
He's just a poor boy from a poor family -
Spare him his life from this monstrosity -
Easy come easy go -, will you let me go -
Bismillah! No -, we will not let you go - let him go -
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go -
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go -
           Will not let you go - let me go
           Will not let you go - let me go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no -
Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go -
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me -
                                        for me -

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye -
So you think you can love me and leave me to die -
Oh Baby - Can't do this to me baby -
Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here -

Nothing really matters,
Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters -, nothing really matters to me,
Anyway the wind blows...

Comfortably Numb~
Hello hello helo...
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me.
Is there anyone home?
Come on, now.
I hear you're feeling down.
Well I can ease your pain,
Get you on your feet again.
Relax relax relax...
I need some information first.
Just the basic facts:
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain, you are receding.
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'.
When I was a child I had a fever.
My hands felt just like two balloons.
Now I got that feeling once again.
I can't explain, you would not understand.
This is not how I am.
I have become comfortably numb.
Ok ok ok...
Just a little pinprick. <ping>
There'll be no more --Aaaaaahhhhh!
But you may feel a little sick.
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working. Good.
That'll keep you going for the show.
Come on it's time to go.
There is no pain, you are receding.
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'.
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse,
Out of the corner of my eye.
I turned to look but it was gone.
I cannot put my finger on it now.
The child is grown, the dream is gone.
I have become comfortably numb.

Crash Boom Bang!~
   My Papa told me to stay out of trouble
   "When you've find your man, make sure he's for real!".
   I've learned that nothing really lasts forever
   I sleep with the scars I wear that won't heal
   They won't heal.

   Cos every time I seem to fall in love
   Crash! Boom! Bang!
   I find the heart but then I hit the wall
   Crash! Boom! Bang!
   That's the call, that's the game
   And the pain stays the same.

   I'm walking down this empty road to nowhere
   I pass by the houses and blocks I once knew.
   My Mama told me not to mess with sorrow
   But I always did, and Lord, I still do
   I'm still breaking the rules
   I kick it up, I kick it down.

   Cos every time I seem to fall in love
   Crash! Boom! Bang!
   I find the heart but then I hit the wall
   Crash! Boom! Bang!
   That's my real middle-name
   It has always been the same
   That's the call, that's the game
   And the pain stays the same.

   I still feel the heat
   Slowly fallin' from the sky
   And the taste of the kissing
   Shattered by rain
   Comin' tumblin' from behind
   And the wild holy war.
   I kick it up, I kick it down
   And every time I seem to fall in love
   Crash! Boom! Bang!
   I find the roses dying on the floor
   Crash! Boom! Bang!
   That's the call, that's the game
   And the pain stays the same.
   That's my real middle-name
   It has always been the same.

   Oh Yeah Oh Yeah Oh Yeah Uh-Huh
   Been the same, been the same
   It has always been the same.

Imagine~
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

   I once knew a girl I can't remember her name
   But I remember her face Cos her sister looked the same.
   They both left school, but they couldn't find a job
   So they said farewell and stole a small town car.

   As they were riding by the beach some summer night
   The radio shouted out one of those, songs
   that might just change your life
   - It went like this:

   "Checkin' in checkin' out
   Making love I like watching all your fireworks
   I like it when I light those stars in your eyes
   Just like fireworks in the sky"
   - yes it did...

   Throwing some poems to the ports and docks
   They were sleeping outdoors pushing all their luck.

   They send me a letter full of pills and thrills
   Then they both got rich and moved to Hollywood Hills.
   Yea they made lots of money playing folk guitar
   Cos everywhere the boys went crazy just to hear
   These words of art:

   "Checkin' in checkin' out, take it to the sky
   Making love I like watching all your fireworks
   I like it when I light those stars in your eyes
   Just like fireworks in the sky".

   They're coming to get you
   They're coming to get you now
   Coming to get you now
   Watch the sky!

   I'll tell you what I've done
   I'll tell you what I do
   Been driving all nite
   Just to get close to you
   Baby Babe - I'm moving so fast
   You'd better come on.

   The moon is alright
   The freeway heading south
   My heart is going Boom!
   There's a strange taste in my mouth
   Baby Babe - I'm moving real fast
   So try to hold on
   Try to hold on!

   Sleeping in my car - I will undress you
   Sleeping in my car - I will caress you
   Staying on the back seat of my car making up.

   So come out tonight
   I'll take you for the ride
   This steamy ol' wagon
   The radio is getting wild
   Baby Babe - we're moving so fast
   I try to hold on
   Try to hold on!

   Sleeping in my car - I will undress you
   Sleeping in my car - I will caress you
   Staying on the back seat of my car making love, oh yeah.
   Sleeping in my car - I will possess you
   Sleeping in my car - certainly bless you
   Laying on the back seat of my car making up.

   The night is so pretty and so young
   The night is so pretty and so young
   So very young...

   Sleeping in my car - I will undress you
   Sleeping in my car - I will caress you
   Staying on the back seat of my car making love to you.
   Sleeping in my car - I will possess you
   Sleeping in my car - certainly bless you
   Laying on the back seat of my car making up.

   I will undress you
   I will undress you
   The night is so pretty and so young.

Some people call me the space cowboy.
Yea...
Some call me the gangster of love.
Some people call me Maurice.
Cause I speak of the pompotous of love.
People talk about me baby.
Say I'm doing you wrong, doing you wrong.
Well you worry, baby, don't worry.
Cause I'm right here, right here,
Right here, right here at home.
Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner,
I'm a lover, I'm a sinner.
I play my music in the sun.
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker.
I'm midnight toker.
I get my lovin' on the run.
You're the cutest thing that I ever did see.
I really love your peaches. Wanna shake your tree.
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time.
Ohey, baby, I'll sure show you a good time.
Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner,
I'm a lover, I'm a sinner.
I play my music in the sun.
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker.
I'm midnight toker.
Sure don't want to hurt no one.
People keep talking about me, baby.
Say I'm doing you wrong.
Well you worry, don't worry,
No don't worry mama.
Cause I'm right here at home.
You're the cutest thing that I ever did see.
I really love your peaches. Wanna shake your tree.
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time.

One Of My Turns~
Oh my God, what a fabulous room!
Are all these your guitars?
This place is bigger than our apartment.
Uh, could I have a drink of water?
Ya want some?  Huh?
Oh wow!  Look at this tub!
Wanna take a bath?
What're you watching?
Hello?
Are you feeling ok?
Day after day,
Our love turns gray,
Like the skin on a dying man.
And night after night,
We pretend it's all right,
But I have grown older,
And you have grown colder,
And nothing is very much fun, anymore.
And I can feel,
One of all my turns coming on.
I feel,
Cold as a razor blade,
Tight as a tourniquet,
Dry as a funeral drum.
Run to the bedroom,
In the suitcase on the left,
You'll find my favorite axe.
Don't look so frightened,
This is just a passing phase,
One of my bad days.
Would you like to watch TV?
Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate a silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat?
Would you like to learn to fly?  -- Would ya?
Would you like to see me try?
Ooohh. No!
Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?

Roxette~
What's she like~
   What's she like when she turns around to kiss you goodnight?
   When she wakes up in the morning by your side?
   What's she like?

   What's she like?
   The yellow moon or the deep blue of the sea?
   Do you feel the same way you did when it was me?
   What's she like?

   Oh, I've been holding on
   I've been holding on for too long
   I've been holding on
   I've been holding on much too long.

   What's she like you're making love and stars are in her eyes?
   When you're looking for the answers in her smile
   What's she like?

   Oh, I've been holding on
   I've been holding on for too long
   I've been holding on
   I've been holding on much too long.
   Too long.

   I never knew I could love somebody the way I loved you
   I never thought I'd be the broken-hearted
   Well, nothing hurts you like the truth.

   So what's she like when she turns to you, when push comes to shove?
   When she whispers in your ear that she's in love?
   What's she like?

   Oh, I've been holding on
   I've been holding on for too long
   I've been holding on
   I've been holding on much too long.
   So what's she like?

Silent Lucidity~
Hush now, don't you cry
Wipe away the teardrop from your eye
You're lying safe in bed
It was all a bad dream
Spinning in your head
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
Of someone close to you leaving the game of life
So here it is, another chance
Wide awake you face the day
Your dream is over... or has it just begun?
There's a place I like to hide
A doorway that I run through in the night
Relax child, you were there
But only didn't realize it and you were scared
It's a place where you will learn
To face your fears, retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind
Commanding in another world
Suddenly you hear and see
This magic new dimension
I will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you, in Silent Lucidity
Visualize your dream
Record it in the present tense
Put it into a permanent form
If you persist in your efforts
You can achieve dream control
Dream control
How's that then, better?
Hug me
If you open your mind for me
You won't rely on open eyes to see
The walls you built within
Come tumbling down, and a new world will begin
Living twice at once you learn
You're safe from the pain in the dream domain
A soul set free to fly
A round trip journey in your head
Master of illusion, can you realize
Your dream's alive, you can be the guide but...
I will be watching over you
I am gonna help to see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you....

Place your love~
   Sunday
   Sick o' my tears
   Monday morning
   I could've felt much better.
   Tuesday
   You're in my way
   I wish you would type
   My heart a letter.

   Place your love
   In my world
   It's for you
   It's made for you
   I need time
   A lot o' time
   To get you off my mind
   To get you off my mind.

   Wednesday
   Nuthin's OK
   Thursday afternoon
   I wish I was sleepin'.
   Friday and Saturday sun
   Gettin' up early but I can't get nuthin' done.

   Place your love
   In my world
   It's for you
   It's all made for you
   I need time
   A lot o' time
   To get you off my mind
   To get you off my mind.

   Maybe you'll come here
   Maybe you'll disappear
   Maybe she clouds I fear
   Will to flowers in the air

   These cool vibrations
   They're hitting me all time
   You've got me diggin' and divin'
   In the garden of my mind.

   It's a high
   To watch you fly
   Across the sky
   All the time
   To watch you all the time.

Goto sleep~
   There's a shadow on the terrace
   A snow dance for the living
   There's heavy weather on the way
   I heard on the news.

   And life's tough principal
   Who won't reward the losers
   Your name is on the tea-cup
   There's nothing I can do.

   But to wish you's think about me
   Before you go to sleep
   And I wish you the best there is
   Before you go to sleep.

   There are tears without the colour
   A million seas of water
   An ocean full of people
   Where shattered hearts can go.

   A love's a golden ripple
   Where answers are so simple
   But the explanations
   Are very hard to do.

   And I wish you's think about me
   Before you go to sleep
   And I wish you the best there is
   Before you go to sleep.
   Go to sleep.

Woman (какаЯ женщина)~
В шумном зале ресторана,
Средь весельЯ и обмана,
Пристань загулЯвшего поэта.
Возле столика напротив,
Ты сидишь в пол-оборота,
ВсЯ в луче ночного света.
Так само случилось вдруг,
Что слова сорвались с губ,
Закружило голову хмельную.
Ах какаЯ женщина,
какаЯ женщина,
Мне б такую.
Пол не чуЯ под собою,
Между небом и землею,
Как во сне с тобой танцую.
Аромат духов так манит,
ОпьЯнЯет и буЯнит,
Ах как сладко в нем тону Я.
Так близки наши тела,
И безумные слова,
Без стыда тебе шепчу Я..
Ах какаЯ женщина,
какаЯ женщина,
Мне б такую.
Ты уйдешь с другим Я знаю,
Он тебЯ давно ласкает,
И тебЯ домой не провожу Я.
Жжет в груди сильней огнЯ,
Не моЯ ты не моЯ,
Так зачем же Я ревную?
Сколько ж нужно мне вина,
Чтобы с памЯти прогнать,
И забыть мечту свою шальную..
Ах какаЯ женщина,
какаЯ женщина,
Мне б такую.

Actress (она была актрисою)~
Она была актрисою
И даже за кулисами
Играла роль, а зрителем был Я.
В душе ее таинственной 
Мирились ложь и истина,
Актрисы непростого ремесла.
Ему единственна верна
Хотела быть она.
И каждый день Я шел за ней,
На зов обманчивых огней,
И с нею жизнь чужую проживал.
Я знал что ей не быть со мной,
Она раба любви иной,
И жизнь ее безумный карнавал..
И славы свет заменит ей
Тепло любви моей.
Красота актрисы так обманчива,
И влечет напрасными надеждами,
Ничего слова ее не значили,
И в судьбе моей все по прежнему.
Она была актрисою
И даже за кулисами
Играла роль а Я хотел любви.
И каждый день идЯ за ней,
На зов обманчивых огней,
Душа моЯ кричала позови..
Но разве свет манил сильней
сильней любви моей
Красота актрисы так обманчива,
И влечет напрасными надеждами,
Ничего слова ее не значили,
И в судьбе моей все по прежнему.

Fade to black~
Life is seems to fade away
Drifting further everyday
Getting lost within my soul
Nothing matters noone else

I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There's nothing more for me
I need the end to set me free

Things are got they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost this can't be real
I can't stand the pain I fear

Emptyness is filling me
To the point of loyalty
Growing darkness taking down
I was me but now he's gone...

The bards' song - In the forest~
Now you all know
the bards and their songs
When hours have gone by
I'll close my eyes
In a world far away
We may meet again
But now hear my song
'bout the dawn of the night
Let's sing the bards' song

Tomorrow will take us away
Far from home
Noone will ever know our names
But the bards' songs will remain
Tomorrow will take it away
The fear of today
It will be gone
Due to our magic songs

There's only one song
Left in my mind
Tales of a brave man
Who lived far from here
Now the bards' songs are over
And it's time to leave
Noone should ask you
For the name of the one
Who tells the story

Tomorrow will take us away
Far from home
Noone will ever know our names
But the bards' songs will remain
Tomorrow all will be known
And you're not alone
So don't be afraid in the dark and cold
'cause the bards' songs will remain
They all will remain
In my thoughts and in my dreams
They're always in my mind
These songs of hobbits dwarves and men
And elves come close your eyes
You can see
Them
Too...

I've lost my battle before it starts
My first breath wasn't gone
My spirit sunken deep into the ground
Why am i alone
I can hear my heartbeat
Silence all around

See hate will rise
So don't come closer fear your child
Born with a king's heart
But fate fooled me and changed my cards
Noone asked if I wanted it
If I liked it

{RPain{x inside is rising
I am the {rfallen one{x
A figure on an old game
No {mjokers{x on my side
I plunged into {Dmisery{x
I turned off the light
And murder the dawn
I turned off the light
And murder the dawn

Nothing else but laughter is around me
Forewer more
Noone can heal me
Noone can save me
Noone can heal me
Wash away the blood from my hands
My father's blood
In agony
We unified
I never wanted to be
What they told me to be
Fullfill my fate and I'll be {Cfree{x
God knows how long
I tried to change {mfate{x

{RPain{x inside is rising
I am the {rfallen one{x
A figure on an old game
No {mjokers{x on my side
I plunged into {Dmisery{x
I turned off the light
And murder the dawn
I turned off the light
And murder the dawn

Rage~
Deep in the blackest hole~
Hey what have they done to you
Say do you mean what you do
Just like a spark that fell aside or what
You're telling me you're lucky
But I know you're not

I look into your eyes and see your heart is black
Are you're afraid of me or why don't you look back
You're telling me to follow
Do it like you said
You'll get me never

What is happened to your life?
Do you really want it so 'cause

I don't want to be like you
The time will come
When everything's too late
Deep in the blackest hole
I'll never be like you
And you will end
Frustrated full of hate
Deep in the blackest hole

You don't like to see the world
Like it is
You try to change it all
You're in defence
Only appologize
You're telling me you're happy
But I know your lies

I look into your eyes and see your heart turns red
Like if you're wounded but no drop of blood is shed
You don't look for a cure instead you-re hurting me
You'll get me never

What is happened to your life?
Everything you had is missing

I don't want to be like you
The time will come
When everything's too late
Deep in the blackest hole
I'll never be like you
And you will end
Frustrated full of hate
Deep in the blackest hole

Addicted to Mud~
The net is up - so you're not home;
Your mind - is not your own.
Your client starts - your body wakes;
One more connect - is what it takes.
You can't sleep - you can't eat;
There's no doubt - you're in deep.
Your fingers ache - but you don't heed;
Another mud - is all you need.

Whoa... You like to think that you're immune to the stuff;
Oh yeah?
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough;
You know you're gonna have to face it:  You're addicted to mud.

You see the words - but you can't read;
Your modem's at - a different speed.
Your fingers type - in double time;
One more connect - and you'll feel fine!
A one track mind - you can't be saved;
Your mudding life - is all you crave.
And if there's room - on your machine,
You'll run your own - Mud Supreme!

Whoa... You like to think that you're immune to the stuff;
Oh yeah?
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough;
You know you're gonna have to face it:  You're addicted to mud.

My ain't as well face it you're addicted to mud.
My ain't as well face it you're addicted to mud.
My ain't as well face it you're addicted to mud.
My ain't as well face it you're addicted to mud.

My ain't as well face it you're addicted to mud.

The net is up - so you're not home;
Your will - is not your own.
Your client starts - the load climbs;
Another mud - and you'll be mine!

Whoa... You like to think that you're immune to the stuff;
Oh yeah?
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough;
You know you're gonna have to face it:  You're addicted to mud.

My ain't as well face it you're addicted to mud.
My ain't as well face it you're addicted to mud.
My ain't as well face it you're addicted to mud.
My ain't as well face it you're addicted to mud.
