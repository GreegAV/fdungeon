     PRIO: Major. Somebody can easely write an exploit.
           Don't you try to look for it in www.rootshell.org yet?
           May be I'll write one ((:
     EXPL: Exploit based on fidding stack frame with proper data.
           This could be easely done by talking to someon in lostlink:
           > tell InnocentBoy {C{W{R{G{b{w{D{G... (colour expantion caused overflow)
           > tell InnocentBoy <NOPs><short_rel_jmp_to_skip_junk>
           > ...
           > tell InnocentBoy <NOPs><put_shell_code_here><shell_code_address>
           It's not too hard to calculate optimum size of the buffer and then
           "shell_code_address", which overwrites function return address 
           (remember 0x3d3d3d3d). Anyone can determine it's value from OS-type 
           and take aproximately - buffer is big enough and filled with NOPs.
           It's enough to point to only one of them.
           When InnocentBoy return from lostlink he will get his REPLAY buffer
           pasted in.
           (all this in case `scroll 0')
     Don't write things like Lope...
