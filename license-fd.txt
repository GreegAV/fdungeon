=== Copyright and License Terms

Forgotten Dungeon Mud based on Rom24b4a, so you must follow the Diku, Rom and Merc
license terms. Their license agreements is in the files 'license.txt', 'license.doc'.
You also can download them from ftp.game.org

Forgotten Dungeon Mud is greatly improved from Rom24b4a and sources has been at most
fully rewritten. So just licence files were untouched :)

Ours license terms are:

 -- Names of FD, Diku, Merc and ROM author's must appear in mud, 
    as them with in their license terms - check 'credits' command.
 -- Copyrights must remain in original source.
 -- If you use any area file from Forgotten Dungeon Mud, it must contain name 
    of the area creator / area translator, if existing.
 -- do not change files that contain only license or copyright text.
    license.fd and other - add your own new files.
 -- Actually a lot of time passed from the moment when we taken the original sources,
    and diku/merc licenses was changed a bit from this time. In additional, I am not
    sure that original authors will respond to you if you email them...
    I would like to change the license to MIT license as the most free with minimum
    limitation, but I am blocked by original source code which I can't drop from the code.
    So...
    Just don't be evil.
    Saboteur aka Sergii Kulyk.
